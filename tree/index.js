// --- Directions
// 1) Create a node class.  The constructor
// should accept an argument that gets assigned
// to the data property and initialize an
// empty array for storing children. The node
// class should have methods 'add' and 'remove'.
// 2) Create a tree class. The tree constructor
// should initialize a 'root' property to null.
// 3) Implement 'traverseBF' and 'traverseDF'
// on the tree class.  Each method should accept a
// function that gets called with each element in the tree

// <108. Tree Overview>
// üìå tree traversal: iterating through all the different elements within a tree
// -> 2 distinct ways in which we order the elements and iterate through those elements
// 1) Breadth-First Traversal
// 2) Depth-Frist Traversal: essentially with Depth-Frist Traversal, we try to get to the bottom of the tree as quickly as possible.

// <109. Node Implementation>
// ‚úçÔ∏è add(data): given some data, create a new node and add it to the current node's 'children' array

// <110. More on Nodes>
// ‚úçÔ∏è remove(data): given some data, look at each child of the current node and remove any node with data === data

// ‚úçÔ∏è filter
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr = arr.filter((element) => {
  return element === 1;
}); // [1]
// -> filter does not modify the arr array, so after doing this filter call, we will assign the result to the arr

// üìé test.js
// (17) we are creating a new node with some data 'a'
// (18) we then add on some element 'b'
// -> so n now has one child and that child is a node with data 'b'
// (19) we can then make an assertion about the number of children that n has,
// (20) or we can access that child directly by looking at the children array and getting the first element out of it; then we can say, look at the children that element has. So this would be the children of node 'b' right here; this test is just asserting to make sure that node 'b' doesn't end up with any children because we didn't actually add any in this case

class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    // initialize the data variable
    this.data = data;
    // create an empty array of children
    this.children = []; // so every single node has this children array, so every child have some number of children. We can tell which nodes are a child of a given node by just looking at the children array.
  }

  add(data) {
    // const node = new Node(data);
    // this.children.push(node);
    this.children.push(new Node(data));
  }

  remove(data) {
    this.children = this.children.filter((node) => {
      return node.data !== data;
    });
  }
}
