// --- Directions
// 1) Create a node class.  The constructor
// should accept an argument that gets assigned
// to the data property and initialize an
// empty array for storing children. The node
// class should have methods 'add' and 'remove'.
// 2) Create a tree class. The tree constructor
// should initialize a 'root' property to null.
// 3) Implement 'traverseBF' and 'traverseDF'
// on the tree class.  Each method should accept a
// function that gets called with each element in the tree

// <108. Tree Overview>
// ðŸ“Œ tree traversal: iterating through all the different elements within a tree
// -> 2 distinct ways in which we order the elements and iterate through those elements
// 1) Breadth-First Traversal
// 2) Depth-Frist Traversal: essentially with Depth-Frist Traversal, we try to get to the bottom of the tree as quickly as possible.
